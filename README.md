## What it is
UniSwap is a hyper-localized digital marketplace for college students that aims to provide a sustainable solution for buying and selling used goods. Our platform is designed to help reduce waste and environmental harm caused by shipping, packaging, and transporting goods.

## How we built it
UniSwap was built using a combination of Python, Flask, and MongoDB. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript provided the framework for the website's frontend, allowing us to create a user-friendly and visually appealing interface.

The backend of the website was built using Python, Flask, and MongoDB. Flask allowed us to create a fast and efficient server, while MongoDB provided a scalable and flexible database solution. The combination of these technologies allowed us to store and retrieve user data quickly and efficiently, providing a smooth experience for our users.

To handle the authentication, we utilized a Google API to implement Google sign in and verifications to assure the user is a university student. This allowed us to securely store user information and ensure that only authorized users had access to sensitive data.

## Challenges we ran into
Time was another major challenge we faced. We had set an ambitious goal to produce a fully functioning website in just 36 hours, but we quickly realized that our timeline was overly optimistic. This meant that we had to make some tough choices and prioritize the most essential features for version 1, leaving some of our more complex ideas for later.

Additionally, getting familiarized with new frameworks and technologies was a challenge for many of our team members. Integrating the backend and frontend was also a significant challenge, but we were able to overcome these obstacles and deliver a functional product.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Creating fully functional databases that store users and products, along with our development of working full stack pages. We're confident that the combination of our user-friendly interface and powerful features will make UniSwap the go-to app for students right on campus. These accomplishments are just the beginning, and we're excited to continue improving and expanding upon the app in the future.

## What we learned
Working on UniSwap has been an incredibly valuable learning experience. We've gained a deeper understanding of the challenges and complexities involved in developing a functional and user-friendly website.

One of the biggest lessons we learned was the importance of being realistic about timelines and project ideating. Another key lesson was the value of teamwork and collaboration. By working together and leveraging each other's strengths, we were able to overcome the challenges we faced and deliver a functional product.

## What's next for UniSwap
We hope to continue growing and expanding our platform through the development of a mobile app. Bringing greater awareness and building a strong community of student buyers and shoppers will help reduce waste and promote sustainability. We also plan to explore new features and functionalities that can enhance the user experience on our platform. This may include integrating new payment options through Venmo and Apple Pay. Overall, we're excited about the potential of UniSwap and look forward to continuing to provide a valuable and sustainable solution to college students.
